## Current Readings

I believe the ability to digitize and share incredibly eye-opening works about the rectitude of how we should use and see computer science as a force of good is pertinent. That said, it is crucial to analyze, criticize, and reform the CS industry and CS education through various social and philosophical texts. And most importantly, my opinions rightfully evolve as I consume more and more information; hope this can be a space where we can all learn together!

I have gathered these readings through the generous guidance various public resources, current CS undergrad and PhD students. Would not been able to have such a comprehensive collection if it weren't for many wonderful and generous folx in the industry. To the best of my ability, I have categorized my readings as such (keep in mind that in the end, all of these readings cannot fall under any one category, every idea connects to each other!)
