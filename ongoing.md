# Ongoing project and initiatives

## CS Energy project
I am currently working with [Professor Kevin Webb](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~kwebb/) in the CS department to create a system that allows lab computers to self regulate themselves in a way that minimizes energy usage. While we have a working system, it is very difficult to start conducting tests (to quantify effectiveness) because the CS department facilities are closed. We hope that by Fall 2021, we can start collecting data and publish our results through a research paper. Here is the current [github](https://github.com/alisonkim12/CSEnergyProject) of one component (the rest is under Kevin's repo!)

## Swatties for Immigrant Rights
As a member of Swatties for Immigrant Rights, we hope to expand our presence in the Swarthmore community in hopes of leveraging student body support for initiating institutional reform for the undocumented/DACAmented community. I am currently developing a website through a handy CSS framework,[Bulma](https://bulma.io) that features current resources for undocumented/DACAmented Swarthmore students and our allies! Look out for a website in the near future!

## Tech for Social Good
I am a member of Tech for Social Good, a club on campus devoted to utilizing our CS capabilities as a form for social good. I am part of the following committees:

### Digest Committee
Currently working with fellow member Sharon to create bi-monthly digests that advertises tech and social good related events and opportunities while featuring tech and social good related reading recommendations students can engage in!

### Ethics TA Committee
I personally believe that the CS department at Swarthmore desperately needs to evolve in a way that features social ethics of technology as a fundamental component of CS education. This committe is devoted to working with CS faculty to implement a new program in the department called Ethics TAs, a group of students responsible for working directly with CS facutly to seamlessly incorporate ethics curriculums to existing courses.

### Teaching a student-led course about the critical theory of CS
My dream is to be able to teach a student-led course about the critical theory of technology with Tech for Social Good members. We are currently working on building a curriculum that we hope to teach in in Fall 2021. If you are potentially interested, please let me know!

## Next internship: LEDA Health
The next internship that I will be partaking in is starting Jan 2021 with [LEDA health](https://www.leda.co).
