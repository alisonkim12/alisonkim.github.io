# Brief introduction

I'm Alison, a sophomore at Swarthmore College studying computer science, educational studies, and the critical theory of technology. If you are interested in any of the aforementioned disciplines, stick around! In this website I will highlight some of the projects and initiatives I am a part of, including a research project, a college access program, written reflections of literary works related to science, technology, and society (STS).

If you are interested to learn more about me, [click here](./about.html).

## I am interested in exploring the following questions:
1. How can we decentralize and deconstruct western, eurocentric ideologies of progress and innovation by reimagining the Computer Science curriculum in higher academia and introduce the history of modern technology and computer science as blooming from 1960s counterculture that implicitly endowed the silicon valley billionaire liberal communists of our generation under the guise of a self made, modern "savior"?

2. How does Critical Race Theory (especially regarding the ongoing Algorithmic Bias, and Machine Learning Bias affecting black and brown communities) allow us to reimagine modern technology as a form of politics in and of itself, through its power of altering and influencing the capacity and the direction of specific human action and thought?

3. How is the growing world of convenience and accessibility through technological advancements in a late capitalist society a detriment to our phenological capacity to feel, live, think critically, and burnout?
